We encourage prospective participants to submit abstracts of proposed lightning talks (limit of 1 page, no format prescribed) on topics related to RSE issues. We particularly encourage talks on this year's workshop theme of "RSEs and the Future of Computing" such as:
- How will RSEs contribute to new technologies such as AI/ML, quantum computing, neuromorphic computing?

Other possible topics include, but are not limited to:
- Career paths: how should RSEs be hired, promoted and evaluated?
- Building RSE organizations: how to find RSEs in your country/region and how to motivate them to join the network and engage?
- Supporting RSE organizations: what can be done to help RSEs (and those supporting RSEs) at international, national, regional, and local levels?
- Making the business case for RSEs and RSE groups: evidence, case studies, tactics
- How do we want funders to support RSE roles and activities?
- Building in RSE requirements as part of wider research infrastructure
- Providing mentoring and training for RSEs

The authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to present lightning talks or participate in panel discussions at the workshop. Note that SC24 is planning an in-person event and presenting in-person is encouraged. A supporting digital experience will accommodate those who cannot attend in-person due to travel restrictions or health concerns. Accepted abstracts will be posted on the workshop website as part of the agenda.

We particularly encourage submissions from first-time conference presenters, and from members of groups that have historically been underrepresented in the HPC community.

Abstracts should be submitted to the submission website <https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=Submit&id=SCWorkshopRSEHPCSubmission&site=sc24>. The deadline for submissions is Friday, August 2, 2024, at 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12).
